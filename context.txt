## **Section 1: About Me (STORY-DRIVEN)**

Adapt Tanzir's research passion statement to YOUR healthcare mission:

```markdown
## ABOUT ME

I BELIEVE IN ACCESSIBLE HEALTHCARE & EDUCATION

I want to move forward with building AI systems that bridge the healthcare 
and education gap for underserved communities. It gives me immense passion 
and purpose when I work on problems that directly impact people who are 
usually left behind.

Growing up in rural Bangladesh where good doctors and hospitals were rare, 
I witnessed families travel hours for basic medical care—or go untreated. 
This shaped my life's work: using artificial intelligence to make quality 
healthcare and education accessible to those who need it most.

My research interests include Trustworthy Healthcare AI, Fairness & 
Explainability in ML, Multimodal Medical Diagnostics, Large Language Models 
for Clinical Decision Support, and AI for Education.

### **B. RESEARCH: Advancing Trustworthy Healthcare AI**

**1. M-TRUST: Medical AI Fairness Framework**  
*Open-Source Toolkit | 2024*

**Problem:** Discovered that multimodal fusion in chest X-ray diagnosis amplified demographic bias by 7.6%—making AI systems potentially harmful for underserved populations.

**Solution:** Built comprehensive fairness detection toolkit implementing 4 metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration, individual fairness).

**Impact:**  
✓ Reduced bias by 30.8% while maintaining 98% accuracy  
✓ Published as open-source Python package on PyPI  
✓ Enables reproducible fairness audits with one-line API

**Publications:** 2 peer-reviewed papers (Q1 journals)  
**Open Source:** [PyPI Package](link) | [GitHub](link) | [Paper](DOI)

***

**2. ExplainRAG-FC-AS: Clinical Decision Support System**  
*RAG-based LLM for Healthcare | 2024*

**Problem:** Traditional LLMs hallucinate medical advice, making them unsafe for clinical use.

**Solution:** Developed retrieval-augmented generation system with fact-checking that grounds every recommendation in verifiable medical evidence.

**Innovation:**  
✓ Thematic clustering + NLI verification before generation  
✓ Sub-10s response time with 0.85 mean evidence confidence  
✓ 90% clinician preference vs. baseline systems

**Impact:** Enables source-level attribution for transparent, auditable clinical AI that doctors can trust.

**Tech Stack:** LangChain, RAG, Sentence-BERT, GPT-4, FAISS  
[GitHub](link) | [Demo](link) | [Paper - Under Review]

***

**3. Parkinson's Disease Prediction with Explainable AI**  
*Feature Engineering + XAI | 2025*

**Problem:** Healthcare providers need interpretable AI—black-box models aren't clinically trusted.

**Solution:** Built interpretable ML framework using SHAP, LIME, and feature engineering for Parkinson's prediction.

**Results:**  
✓ 92% accuracy with full clinical interpretability  
✓ Identified top 5 biomarkers for early detection  
✓ Published in PLOS ONE (Q1, Impact Factor 2.6)

**Impact:** Demonstrates how trustworthy AI can support early diagnosis while maintaining clinical transparency.
